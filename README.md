# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis


## Overview of the analysis:

The HR Department at Pewlett Hackard needed an analysis (such as number of staff, department, and title) of potential staff retirements. Because a significant portion of the company is close to requirement, HR would like to set up a mentorship program based on years of experience. 

1. ***Deliverable 1***: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
2. ***Deliverable 2***: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
3. ***Deliverable 3***: A written report on the employee database analysis

* There are 1,940 employees elibible for the mentorship program
